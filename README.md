Qtino.Spritz

This project is intended to provide a platform-agnostic wrapper around the Spritz SDK. Currently, it only supports iOS (a 'dummy' OSX implementation is provided for prototyping purposes). 

Android support should follow shortly.

To use, just build the project against your desired Qt version (only tested with Qt 5.3) and it should be automatically installed in the default Qml import directory.

See the "SpritzPluginTest" project included in this repo for API usage details.
